							<h3>Why the world will not end if the Cubs win the 2015 World Series</h3>
							<br>
							<p>The Chicago Cubs are currently (as of October 19 2015) playing the New York Mets in the 2015 
							National League Championship Series, potentially eight victories away from winning the World Series, 
							something that has not happened since 1907.  As baseball lore goes, the team is cursed,
							and a World Series victory would be an event of cosmic proportions, possibly signaling end of times itself.  
							This begs the question: just how unlikely is an 107-year drought?<br> 	
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For simplicity, let us first assume that in any given year, 
							each team has equal chance of winning the WS.  From the Cubs' point of view, 
							the probability of it not winning the WS since 1907 is about 0.38%, i.e. very unlikely. 
							However, what is the probability that <i>some</i> team hasn't won the WS since 1907? 
							By my <a href="https://github.com/shanshanding/miscellaneous/blob/master/worldSeriesDroughts.py">
							simulation</a>*, it is about 6%, i.e. not probable, but not impossible. 
							This is similar to the Birthday Paradox: if you walk into a room of 30 people, the probability 
							that someone has the same birthday as you is low (~8%), but the probability that 
							some pair of people share the same birthday is quite high (~70%).<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are on the topic, the probability that at least 2 teams 
							did not win the WS from 1919 to 2003, as was the case with the Cubs and the Red Sox, is a little over 1%. 
							Not something anyone would have predicted in 1918, but had the two met in the 2003 WS (both teams 
							advanced to their respective league's Championship Series that year), 
							the world likely would not have ended either.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should remember though that while the Cubs and the Red Sox 
							received all the attention, there was a third team that did not win a championship between 1919 and 2003: 
							the Chicago White Sox, who, before winning the WS in 2005, last won in 1917.  Together this trio of futility 
							does push the limits of incredulity, as the probability of three teams concurrently trapped in 85-year droughts
							appears to be less than 0.04%.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, as a die-hard Cleveland Indians fan, 
							what is the probability that, conditioning on the Cubs's drought, some other team hasn't won 
							the WS since 1948, as is the case with the Indians? It is actually about 53%! So sure, the Indians 
							have been very unlucky, but it's almost as if a flip of a coin decided that some team has to be that unlucky, 
							and that team just happens to be the Indians (well, that, and decades of mismanagement).<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we leave this discussion, let us consider what happens to our model if, 
							as it happens in reality, not all teams have equal chance of winning the WS.  I don't have a rigorous proof, 
							but my hunch is that the above simulations in fact give lower bounds on what they are estimating.  
							I think if we were to write out explicit formulas that compute these probabilities, 
							we would see that such formulas can be optimized using Lagrange multipliers, 
							and that by symmetry, uniform distribution on winning gives a local extremum.  The question is whether it is a max 
							or a min.  For that we consider a non-uniform example: if a team always have zero chance of winning the WS, then 
							it will have a drought of arbitrary length, and therefore the probability of <i>some</i> team having a drought of 
							any length is 1.  This suggests that the probability of drought increases as distribution on winning shifts away 
							from uniformity.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the probability of some team not winning the World Series since 1907 is at 
							least 6% and possibly considerably higher.  If 2015 is the year that the Cubs's drought finally ends, it would be the 
							end of a streak that, while painful for generations of Cubs fans, is not really all that mathematically remarkable 
							in and of itself.  However, do consider the droughts of the Red Sox (1919-2003, winning WS in 2004) and the White Sox 
							(1918-2004, winning WS in 2005), and how neatly the Cubs winning the 2015 WS would completely the symmetry.  
							As we speak, the Cubs are down 2 games to none to the Mets.  If they do manage to make it to the World Series 
							and win, well, that would be of some numerological interest.
							</p>
							<p>*One might ask why, if we know $p$, one team's probability of not winning the WS since 1907, we cannot simply 
							compute the probability of <i>some</i> team not winning the WS since 1907 with the formula $1-(1-p)^{\text{numTeams}}$.
							The reason is that teams's records are not independent.  To be fair, the dependence is very weak and 
							the aforementioned formula does yield about 6% as well.</p>
